To make Kali painlessly bootable on Dell XPS 15, Execute the following in the same directory as your kali linux ISO:

sed 's/quiet splash noeject/nouveau.modeset=0   /' youriso.iso > outputiso.iso



To disable the boot beep, search for 'menu title Boot menu' in a hex editor. Find the hex digit '07' after that phrase, and replace it with '00'
7 is the ASCII encoding for 'BEL', which causues a beep in the receiving terminal
